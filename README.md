# Making a Neural Network using only Numpy

### About

This **Neural Network** is made completely using `Numpy`.  
Some specifications:

* This model takes in **2** inputs.
* It gives **1** output as a "0" or "1".
* We can set the training iterations and the training dataset while calling the `train()` function.

### How this works

This model uses a `sigmoid`, `sigmoid_p` and `cost` funtion to get the cost and set the weights and biases according to it in order to reduce the cost and optimise the Neural Network to get the best output.

### dependencies

We'll need :
* `numpy` for all the maths
* `matplotlib` for data visualization
